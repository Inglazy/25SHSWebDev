  <p>Michael Jordan began his professional basketball career when he joined the Chicago Bulls in 1984 after being drafted third overall in the NBA draft. His first NBA game was on October 26, 1984. Michael Jordan initially joined the Washington Wizards in January 2000 as a minority owner and president of basketball operations. He then returned to playing for the Wizards as a player in September 2001, fulfilling a promise he made to Washington before his initial retirement. Jordan retired for the second time in January 1999, returning for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards. Though he scored his 30,000th career point on January 4, 2002, against his former team, the Bulls, Jordan was never able to lead the Wizards into playoff competition. He retired for the third and final time on April 16, 2003.</p>
