          <p class="text">Look at him, every disgusting bug part that was forced into him by those who couldn't care less. </p>

          <p class="text"> Such a shame, I would have had fun toying with his soul.</p>
          <p class="text"> What did she see in him? What did she see in any of them? </p>
          <p class="text"> He should have been crushed like the pest he is.</p>
