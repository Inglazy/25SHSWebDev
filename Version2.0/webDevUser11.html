13. Pretty cool, huh? Go ahead and make changes to you smiley face.  

To make changes to the smiling face you will edit any of the attributes from the code above.  If you are unsure of where to start you can go to "div#face" and change background from yellow to any other color you choose.  
Try and change any of the numbers you see.  It works best to make one change and then see what it does.  That way if you really mess it up you only have to undo 1 change. 
Part II: Specific Containers
14. So if <div> is a generic container are there non-generic containers, otherwise known as specific containers?

OF COURSE!!!

15. Here is just a short list of different containers that we can use that have specific uses. 

<aside>
<blockquote>
<cite>
<code>
<data>
<figure>
<var>
<time>
<address>
<article>
 16. Besides these 10 elements let's look at the <section> element. 

The <section> element has a typical format like shown below
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
<h1>PUT YOUR BIG TITLE HERE</h1>
<section>
    <h2>Introduction or 1st Point</h2>
    <p>Content in here that explains your 1st point</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>2nd Point</h2>
    <p>Content in here that explains your 2nd point</p>
</section>
17.  Somewhere in your WebDevUser##.html file place a specific container you can use <section> or any of the other examples listed above or found on your own. 

Your content must contain something. Something Web Developers commonly use is the "Lorem Ipsum" text, which is just dummy text used for getting a feel of layout.  You can use this resource https://loremipsum.io/Links to an external site. to generate any number of paragraphs to use as "dummy text". 
Part III: Saving Changes and submitting a pull request 
18. Although your changes are saved on your local computer, they are not stored permanently by git. To create a permanent checkpoint of this change, you need to make a commit. In GitHub desktop enter a summary and description then select Commit to master.   

19. You need to sync your local changes to the remote repository on GitHub. Since your changes are only on your computer, it will ask to publish.  Click on either of the "Push origin" buttons. (Black menu button or Blue button in viewing window)  Then you will be allowed to push those commits to your origin. 1.1.1 push origin.PNG  

20. Create a Pull Request so your changes can be merged into the original code. You can go to Branch---> Create pull request or shortcut cmd+R. 1.1.1 pull request part4.png

This will bring you to the GitHub website where you can compare your changes and create a pull request. Verify that you are able to merge, and click on the create pull request button.  1.1.1 pull request part5.PNG
If you have more than 1 commit in this pull request you will need to include a title and a description before you can click on the Create Pull Request button.
